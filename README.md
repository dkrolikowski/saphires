# SAPHIRES
SAPHIRES - Stellar Analysis in Python for HIgh REsolution Spectroscopy

Installation:
pip install saphires

This python package includes some common tools for the analysis of high resolution spectra 
that don't typically have easily accessible python versions.

It currently includes:

- TODCOR (Two-Dimensional Cross Correlation)

- Spectral-Line Broadening Functions

It will soon include the following tools:

- Fourier Cross Correlation

This code is actively being developed with the help of Danny Krolikowski, Natalie Gosnell, and Emily Leiner.
