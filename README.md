It's called ASHES - Analysis Suite for High-resolution Echelle Spectroscopy

This python package includes some common tools for the ananlysis of high resolution spectroscopy 
that don't typically have esaily accessible python verions.

It currently includes nothing, but will soon include the following tools:
